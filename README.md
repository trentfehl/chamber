# chamber
Kitchen countertop thermal chamber used for longer duration culinary
processes that require precise temperature control such as sourdough 
starter care, pickling, and others.

This project was accepted as a demo presentation at the 2019 Hackaday
Superconference! Hackaday wrote a really nice article about the project
too: https://hackaday.com/2020/01/08/engineering-your-way-to-better-sourdough-and-other-fermented-goods/

### Roadmap
 - Switch controlled interior lights
 - Custom PCB to reduce cost and clean up look (maybe a RPi hat!)
 - Mechanical design improvements: hinged door, stackable, insulation
